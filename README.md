# Project-9
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The task is to determine the optimal location for a new oil well for the OilyGiant mining company.

The process involves the following steps:

Collect oil well parameters in the chosen region, including oil quality and reserve volume.
Build a model to predict the reserve volume in new wells.
Select oil wells with the highest estimated values.
Identify the region with the highest total profit based on the selected oil wells.
Data on oil samples from three regions is provided, and the parameters for each well are already known. The goal is to build a model that identifies the region with the highest profit margin. The analysis includes evaluating potential profit and risks using the Bootstrapping technique.
